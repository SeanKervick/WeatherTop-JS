<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

* This is a college assignment of a companion web app that allows users to make an account by signing up with their email address and password to create weatherstations and store readings.
* Users can then add readings to the stations and the application then displays weather information based on the latest readings that have been added.
* Calculations are performed to display information such as celsius to farenheit, wind direction & wind chill.
* The information is then stored in a .json file, saved for when the user logs in again.
