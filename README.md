# WeatherTop 2.0
Welcome to the WeatherTop App!

This is an application that allows users to make an account by 
signing up with their email address and password to create multiple
weatherstations.
Users can then add readings to the stations. The application
then displays details based on the latest readings that have been 
added.
Calculations are performed to display information such as celsius to 
farenheit, wind direction & wind chill.
The information is then stored in a .json file, saved for when the 
user logs in again.
